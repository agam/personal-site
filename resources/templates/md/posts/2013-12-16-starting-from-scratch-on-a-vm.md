I've started from scratch many times on new linux installations. It gets old after a while though, so I prefer to do it as infrequently as possible.



Getting started with a bare-bones VM is one of the occasions for this, so I'll take the time to record what I do so that I don't have to revisit this stuff the _next time_.
