Of course, he's no stranger to controversial programming views (["Maybe Monads Might Not Matter"](http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2011/01/maybe-monads-might-not-matter.html), ["Types are anti modular"](http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2011/06/types-are-anti-modular.html), ["Objects are not hash tables"](http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2009/11/objects-are-not-hash-tables.html), and ["Chased by One's Own Tail"](http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2009/12/chased-by-ones-own-tail.html)), so you might enjoy reading his blog after watching the video!
