Using all three (`val`, `var`, `d



ef`), I initialize, and then attempt to reassign. Only `var` succeeds (as it should), but the other two fail in different ways.



```scala



scala> val x = 6

x: Int = 6



scala> x = 7

<console>:11: error: reassignment to val

       x = 7

         ^



scala> var x = 6

x: Int = 6



scala> x = 7

x: Int = 7



scala> def x = 6

x: Int



scala> x = 7

<console>:11: error: value x_= is not a member of object $iw

       x = 7

       ^



```



Deceptively similar at first, but I suppose you get used to it. Also, what the heck is `$iw` ?? (I'm guessing it's an internal Java representation of the `Int` class)
