I love reading rants. Not random, trollish ones, you know, intended only to provoke flamewars -- those are _tiresome_ and (worse!) predictable. No, I like the heartfelt ones, filled with (seemingly) genuine disgust and grief.



Last year I went meticulously through _every single post_ by Erik Naggum (thanks to Zach Beane who took the trouble of curating them[^1]), and found a wealth of quotes. I highly recommend it -- consider it casual reading, a replacement for whatever you plan to read on your next commute, travel trip or vacation.



Anyway, today I found another worthy rant-er, Mr. Adam Rosenberg. Yes, he has a blog with a bunch of interesting articles[^2], he is also a self-described "industrial mathematician", and has written an unabashed defense of Ye Olde FORTRAN and C style as the once and future programming style[^3]. But what made me _binge-read_ his writing was his collection of rants[^4].



A good place to start is ["The Failure of the Digital Computer"](http://www.the-adam.com/adam/rantrave/computers.html), but obviously _YMMV_.
