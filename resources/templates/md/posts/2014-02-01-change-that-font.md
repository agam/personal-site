You don't have to be chained to `Monaco` if you don't like it. I changed it to `Inconsolata`, which is as simply as [downloading it](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) (click on the _Open Type File_ link).

Once you click on the downloaded file, the **Font Book** app should open up automatically, showing the font face and with a `Install` button.



Once you do this (I love this part) _any open font selection windows will refresh automatically_, and you can pick this new font for your terminal (which, by the way, I hope is [iTerm](http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) because ... if not, why?)
