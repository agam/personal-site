Getting music onto an Android phone

==================================



I had bought a MicroSD card to go along with my Motorola Razr M, since it has a limited internal storage of 8G.



(That is to say, _limited_ by today's standards, where a singe Chrome tab can take up a few hundred MB. I remember when I was excited to find a computer with 8MB Ram since that meant I could play Quake on it. Anyway ...)



I assembled everything on my (linux) laptop in one folder, this should just be a copy-and-paste, drag-and-drop kind of thing, right ?



_Wrong_.



Instead I had to wade through a bunch of online forum posts, about mounting the phone on windows, on mac, configuring various settings.



When I plugged in the phone through USB, I got a notification saying the phone was connected but it didn't show up in Ubuntu's list of connected devices (and I know this works for other devices because my external hard drive shows up when I connect i

t).



Finally I found [this](http://www.mysolutions.it/mounting-your-mtp-androids-sd-card-on-ubuntu/), it assured me that _"Fortunately, it’s quite easy to get this working"_.



Of course, it was incomplete (yes, you need `sudo apt-get install mtpfs` but *also* `sudo apt-get install mtp-tools`)



```shell

sudo mkdir /media/MTPDevice

sudo chmod 775 /media/MTPDevice

sudo mtpfs -o allow_other /media/MTPDevice/

```



Finally, I saw



```shell

$ mtp-detect

libmtp version: 1.1.3



Listing raw device(s)

Device 0 (VID=22b8 and PID=2e51) is UNKNOWN.

Please report this VID/PID and the device model to the libmtp development team

   Found 1 device(s):

   22b8:2e51 @ bus 2, dev 9

Attempting to connect device(s)

usb_clear_halt() on INTERRUPT endpoint: No such device

usb_open(): No such device

LIBMTP PANIC: Could not init USB on second attempt

OK.

```



Woo hoo. So much for that.



Then I came across [this](http://penzoditutto.blogspot.it/2012/12/android-mtp-devices-40-mount-scripts.html), which seemed more pragmatic, since it said "If you're using ubuntu (12.04 or 12.10) and you want to browse your Android 4.0+ device _you know how frustrating can be._" Yes I do.



But it didn't have anything fundamentally different.



So I just pulled out the USB cable and plugged it in again ("when all else fails, cycle power")



This time, it worked.



```shell

$ mtp-detect

libmtp version: 1.1.3

Device 0 (VID=22b8 and PID=2e51) is UNKNOWN.

While we're here, a clarification by way of digression: I am not ranting against MTP, just its usability. It is clearly (IMHO) better than the previous mass storage option, since it supports well-defined interfaces to specific file types, such as this one for JPEG files:



```shell

   3801: JPEG

      dc01: Storage ID UINT32 data type ANY 32BIT VALUE form READ ONLY

      dc02: Object Format UINT16 data type ANY 16BIT VALUE form READ ONLY

      dc03: Protection Status UINT16 data type ANY 16BIT VALUE form READ ONLY

      dc04: Object Size UINT64 data type READ ONLY

      dc07: Object File Name STRING data type GET/SET

      dc09: Date Modified STRING data type DATETIME FORM READ ONLY

      dc0b: Parent Object UINT32 data type ANY 32BIT VALUE form READ ONLY

      dc41: Persistant Unique Object Identifier UINT128 data type READ ONLY

      dc44: Name STRING data type READ ONLY

      dce0: Display Name STRING data type READ ONLY

      dc4e: Date Added STRING data type DATETIME FORM READ ONLY

      dc48: Description STRING data type READ ONLY

```



But wait a minute, what happened to the directory I created ?



```shell

$ ls -ld /media/MTPDevice/

ls: cannot access /media/MTPDevice/: Transport endpoint is not connected

```



Obviously I celebrated too soon. More trudging through posts. As an idea of how crazy this can seem, I found [this post](http://askubuntu.com/questions/159095/problems-connecting-android-ics-to-ubuntu-using-mtp) on [askubuntu](http://www.askubuntu.com) which said:



"Please note the Terence Egan Blog where you took the instructions from is a copy of an OMG Ubuntu article. He has missed an important step *to restart your PC before running the Echo commands* I suggest you try and reinstall from the original OMG Ubuntu source. Click on this link" (emphasis mine, link omitted).



Yes, that's right, _*N00b*_. You forgot to restart.



(In case you're wondering how that story ends,

"Oh my god!!! I did not know that. Will do this asap. – ubuntico Jul 3 '12 at 16:40

It worked this way. *I connect the mobile and them immediately (under 1s after connection) I have to start command android-connect. Otherwise, the system will try to mount the mobile and after that I cannot use fuse to mount it.* It the same with you? – ubuntico Jul 3 '12 at 17:08")



Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I would not refer to this tenuous solution as _"it worked"_.



Hmm, it looks like I skipped a step. I had to modify `/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules` to add the right `SUBSYSTEM...` rule, and then `sudo service udev restart`.



Nope, no luck. I can't access, mount, unmount or delete.



```shell

$ fusermount -u /media/MTPDevice 

fusermount: entry for /media/MTPDevice not found in /etc/mtab

$ sudo mtpfs -o allow_other /media/MTPDevice/

fuse: bad mount point `/media/MTPDevice/': Transport endpoint is not connected

$ sudo rmdir /media/MTPDevice

rmdir: failed to remove `/media/MTPDevice': Device or resource busy

```



But wait! All is not lost! We can use the `adb` tool to interact directly with the android filesystem!



```shell

$ ./adb push /media/My\ Book/Music/Amazon\ MP3/Eminem/ /sdcard/Music/

and verify it after running `adb shell`



```shell

shell@scorpion_mini:/ $ ls sdcard/Music/                                       

Recovery [Explicit]

```



So yeah. It works. And it's a _magical_ experience.



*Update*:

To add to my misery, I still can't _play_ the songs. Google Play doesn't pick  them up (no surprise there) but neither does a dedicated music playing app like Winamp.



(Yes, _Winamp!_ It's still around! It still plays the ["whips the llama's ass" clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKqKrH0O9yg) when it starts! But it doesn't find my music ?!)



As far as I can tell, this is because on my phone, the sdcard is mounted on `/storage/sdcard1` instead of `/storage/sdcard0`, and that has made all the difference.
