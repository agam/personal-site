{:title "rethinking the suggested beginning language"

I was all gung-ho about recommending **Go** as the ideal starting point for _everyone_, and abstract driving force behind this was a supposed combination of the ease and power of **Python** and **C** respectively, both of which can individually make a case for being the _right_ place to start.



This depended on two things:



- Leave it to the student to figure out the editor/IDE/tooling, and

- Don't worry about GUIs in the beginning (it's ok to focus on a text interface alone).



Unfortunately, when I discuss this with other people (yes, an unscientific small sample), these seem like dumb assumptions. The accepted wisdom seems to be that



- IDEs are _very_ important, and

- GUIs and web apps _have_ to be the primary focus.



So now I'm confused all over again. I really, _really_ don't want to return to Javascript. Perhaps **Dart** would fit the bill? The default eclipse-ish editor is pretty self-contained and is easy to download and get up and running on all platforms. The syntax is a bit _meh_, but that's just my current ignorance. I don't know. Maybe there _isn't_ any such thing as a good beginner programming language.
