- Shameless plug: [some Emacs evangelism](https://www.slideshare.net/AgamBrahma/emacs-talk)
- Something on [programming language design](https://hackernoon.com/considerations-for-programming-language-design-a-rebuttal-5fb7ef2fd4ba?gi=d5ba58268862)
- Not sure if this belongs (perhaps in the “old” stuff section?), but I’ll leave the title here: _[Programming and meta-programming in the human biocomputer](http://nekhbet.leary.csoft.net/biocomputer.pdf)_
- A primer that’s actually not bad at all, [on _kinds_ in Haskell](https://diogocastro.com/blog/2018/10/17/haskells-kind-system-a-primer/)
- Fascinating account of the [early history](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PDP-10/its/master/doc/eak/emacs.lore) of Emacs
- Some notes I found interesting, on _[The elements of Scale](http://www.benstopford.com/2015/04/28/elements-of-scale-composing-and-scaling-data-platforms/)_
- Some people really do take their fascination with Lisp [too far](http://zahardzhan.github.io/2011/lisp.html)
- Something something something [Perl C++](https://vector-of-bool.github.io/2018/10/31/become-perl.html)
