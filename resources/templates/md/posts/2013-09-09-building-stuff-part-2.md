Learning how to build (part 2)

==================================



I wanted to get an idea of the state of open source C++ tools and idioms, so I decided to pick something small to start with.



Raw materials: getting the libraries

--------------



I already had `boost` and newly built versions of `gcc` and `libstdc++`.



First, I got another networking library I had heard about, [`cpp-netlib`](https://github.com/google/cpp-netlib). (`git clone`, then `git submodule update`)



Next, I got a logging library [`glog`](https://code.google.com/p/google-glog/), and a perf library [`gperftools`](https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/)



(Both of these required me to download a `.tar.gz` file that needed to be uncompressed)



At this point, there was already a problem of how to build stuff (!)



Glog/Gperftools came with the usual `autoconf` system, but `cpp-netlib` had to be built with `CMake`.



```shell

cmake ~/Documents/Code/AmpWorld/cpp-netlib \

  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \

  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/clang_3_3/bin/clang \

  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/clang_3_3/bin/clang++

```

  

Initial problems getting this to work (in roughly chronological order) were:



- I had run `git submodule update` without `git submodule init`, so I had to clear out `CMake` temporaries, then run `init` and `update` to get them

- `Gperftools` didn't build on my machine, and required me to first install `libunwind`

- I had not specified boost include dirs, I had to run (in my case) `export BOOST_INCLUDEDIR=/opt/boost/boost_1_54_0`

- I had not installed the boost libraries that were _not_ header-only (filesystem, regex, date_time, unit_test_framework, etc)

- I couldn't figure out how to pass the right include paths through cmake, I ended up setting the environment variables instead

    (In my case this meant `export C_INCLUDE_PATH=255`.

- After these four, I still got compilation errors

  (e.g. `boost/bind/mem_fn_template.hpp:610:30: error: no matching function for call to 'get_pointer'`)

- I added `-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/gcc_4_7/lib64` to cmake, and ran `make` again

- Now I had different linker errors ... _sigh_ ... undefined references to basic C++ library symbols like `string` in boost code

- Guessed that this might have been because I had built _boost_ with _gcc_

- Tried building the relevant Boost libraries again. This time when I ran "`bootstrap.sh`" again, I got:

  `error: No best alternative for libs/coroutine/build/allocator_sources`

- WTF (!) ... found [a Superuser post that explained](http://superuser.com/questions/614472/error-while-installing-boost-1-54) a workaround,

  which was to edit `libs/coroutine/build/Jamfile.v2`

  ... and now I get _other_ weird errors: `./boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:75:24: fatal error: patchlevel.h: No such file or directory`

- Needed to install stuff: `sudo apt-get install python-dev`

- Now everything _almost_ worked, but one of the files failed to compile: 

  `cpp-netlib/http/src/network/protocol/http/client.ipp:18: undefined reference to network::logging::log(network::logging::log_record const&)'`

- This error was truly bizarre because I located the source file that had this call (`logging/src/network/logging/logging.hpp`)

  and it very explicitly disabled the copy constructor that the linker was complaining of being undefined !

- Digging around in the corresponding `CMakeLists.txt` suggests this might possibly be due to logging being disabled

- (_Will this never end ?_) `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcppnetlib-logging`

- Fine, just turn of the f&*ing tests

 

So finally, this is what worked:



```shell

export CC=/usr/gcc_4_7/bin/gcc4.7

export CXX=/usr/gcc_4_7/bin/g++4.7

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=

  /usr/gcc_4_7/lib:/usr/gcc_4_7/lib64:/opt/boost/boost_1_54_0/stage/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

/usr/local/bin/cmake \

 -DCPP-NETLIB_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \

 -DCPP-NETLIB_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \

 -DCPP-NETLIB_DISABLE_LOGGING=OFF \

 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \

 -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/gcc_4_7/include/c++/4.7.3/ \

 -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/gcc_4_7/lib64 \

 ~/Documents/Code/AmpWorld/cpp-netlib

```



Finally, even this didn't install the libraries where I wanted them. Finally I gave up and just hacked it up:



```shell

`for f in `find /home/agam/Documents/Code/AmpWorld/cpp-netlib/ | grep 'lib.*a$'`; \

 do sudo cp $f /opt/cpp-static-libs/; done`

```

 

Into the furnace: a simple sample

----------



So far so good. Now it was "hello world" time (something that used atleast two of these libraries).



Or for a more basic step, replicate [cpp-netlib's hello world](http://cpp-netlib.org/0.10.1/examples/http/hello_world_client.html) first.



This was the initial version, from the web page referred above.



```C

#include <protocol/http/client.hpp>

#include <string>                  

#include <iostream>                

                                   

namespace http = network::http;

                                   

int main(int argc, char*argv[]) {

  if (argc != 2) {                 

    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << "<url>" << std::endl;

    return 1;                      

  }                                

                                   

  try {                            

    http::client client;           

    http::client::request request(argv[1]);

    http::client::response response = client.get(request);

                                   

    // Print to standard output  

    std::cout << "Received: " << body(response);                                                                                                                                                               

  } catch (std::exception& e) {  

    std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;

    return 1;                      

  }                                

}                                  

                                   

}  // end namespace                

```



(The version in the example on the web page referred above was different in many ways, I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader :) )



Trying to compile it thus:



`g++4.7 -std=c++11 hello-world.cpp -Icpp-netlib/http/src/ -Icpp-netlib/message/src/ -Icpp-netlib/uri/src/  -I/opt/boost/boost_1_54_0 -lcppnetlib-http-client`



(almost there, now I get `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcppnetlib-http-client`)



After a round of tacking on libraries while I continued to get `undefined reference` errors, I gave up and decided it was time to get a makefile ready.



For reference (or shame, or disgust, or trivia), the one-liner I had at this point had grown to



```shell

g++4.7 hello-world.cpp \

  -L/opt/cpp-static-libs/ \

  -lcppnetlib-uri -lcppnetlib-http-client -lcppnetlib-http-message-wrappers \

  -lcppnetlib-http-client-connections -lcppnetlib-constants \

  -lcppnetlib-http-message -lcppnetlib-message -lcppnetlib-logging \

  -L/opt/boost/boost_1_54_0/stage/lib/ -lboost_system -lboost_regex \

  -lssl -lcrypt -std=c++11 \

  -Icpp-netlib/http/src/ -Icpp-netlib/message/src/ -Icpp-netlib/uri/src/ \

  -I/opt/boost/boost_1_54_0

```



Scaffolding and Fire: Creating a makefile

------------------------------------------



Time to learn CMake ! Here's [a good tutorial](http://mathnathan.com/2010/07/getting-started-with-cmake/) or actually here's [a better one](http://web.cs.swarthmore.edu/~adanner/tips/cmake.php)



This is what I came up with for `CMakeLists.txt` :



```cmake

However when I tried to build,



```shell

$ make

Linking CXX executable hello-world

CMakeFiles/hello-world.dir/hello-world.cpp.o: In function `(anonymous namespace)::get_filename(network::uri const&)':

...

```



Eventually (minutes, hours, later! I'll spare you the pain) and after becoming lightly skilled in the arts of CMake, I realized that what I needed to do (or one of the things that I _could_ do) was to explicitly declare the path of the static library, and specify their order.



So I then ended up with something like this (omitting the common parts with the listing above):



```cmake

# Specify static libraries explicitly to make Cmake happy

add_library(CPPNETLIB_URI STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_URI PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-uri.a)

add_library(CPPNETLIB_MESSAGE STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_MESSAGE PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-message.a)

add_library(CPPNETLIB_MESSAGE_DIRECTIVES STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_MESSAGE_DIRECTIVES PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-message-directives.a)

add_library(CPPNETLIB_MESSAGE_WRAPPERS STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_MESSAGE_WRAPPERS PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-message-wrappers.a)

add_library(CPPNETLIB_HTTP_MESSAGE STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_HTTP_MESSAGE PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-http-message.a)

add_library(CPPNETLIB_HTTP_MESSAGE_WRAPPERS STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_HTTP_MESSAGE_WRAPPERS PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-http-message-wrappers.a)

add_library(CPPNETLIB_CONSTANTS STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_CONSTANTS PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-constants.a)

add_library(CPPNETLIB_HTTP_CLIENT STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_HTTP_CLIENT PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-http-client.a)

add_library(CPPNETLIB_HTTP_CLIENT_CONNECTINS STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_HTTP_CLIENT_CONNECTINS PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-http-client-connections.a)

add_library(CPPNETLIB_LOGGING STATIC IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET CPPNETLIB_LOGGING PROPERTY

  IMPORTED_LOCATION /opt/cpp-static-libs/libcppnetlib-logging.a)

 

set(CPPNETLIB_LIBS

  CPPNETLIB_MESSAGE_WRAPPERS

  CPPNETLIB_HTTP_MESSAGE

  CPPNETLIB_MESSAGE

  CPPNETLIB_HTTP_CLIENT

  CPPNETLIB_MESSAGE_DIRECTIVES

  CPPNETLIB_HTTP_CLIENT_CONNECTINS

  CPPNETLIB_URI

  CPPNETLIB_LOGGING

  CPPNETLIB_CONSTANTS

  CPPNETLIB_HTTP_MESSAGE_WRAPPERS

  )

```



So, not only did I have to set the `IMPORTED_LOCATION` of each library (there _has_ to be a better way to do this, doesn't there ?!) but I also had to juggle around their order relative to each other before passing `${CPPNETLIB_LIBS}` to `target_link_libraries`



Forging a networking hello-world, or 'all I want is a wget'

-------------------------------------------------------



Once this was done, I could successfully do the following:



```shell

$ mkdir build && cd build

$ cmake ..

$ make

```



Scanning dependencies of target hello-world

[100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/hello-world.dir/hello-world.cpp.o

Linking CXX executable hello-world

[100%] Built target hello-world



About %$#ing time, eh ?



Well, it still doesn't _quite_ work.



Before we see the non-working case, it's useful to see what happens on bad input:



```shell

```



When I ran `time ./hello-world http://www.google.com`, I got



```shell

real    4m0.135s

user    0m0.020s

sys     0m0.012s

```



There were a series of calls of the following form:



```shell

[network http/client/connection/normal_delegate.ipp:38] normal_delegate::read_some(...)

[network http/client/connection/normal_delegate.ipp:39] scheduling asynchronous read some...

[network http/client/connection/async_normal.ipp:382] end of the line.

[network http/client/connection/async_normal.ipp:399] no callback provided, appending to body...

```



after which it seemed to pause for a few minutes before printing out the received body.



However, this seemed to depend on the url in question. For example, trying it on a static web page that forms part of this blog, `$ time ./hello-world http://agam.github.io/posts/building-boost-clang-gcc.html` yielded



```shell

real    0m10.154s

user    0m0.024s

sys     0m0.004s

```



That's enough, for me, for now. Maybe I'll try the [Poco libraries](http://pocoproject.org/) next and see if they are any better.
