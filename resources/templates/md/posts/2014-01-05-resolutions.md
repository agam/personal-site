It's that time of year again. I can't believe 2013 is already over.



I thought about what possible resolutions I could make, but either nothing came to mind, or too many. One thing that does bug me is that I feel I'm not as good a programmer as I once was. And so I have a simple resolution: improve on "always be coding".



There is a simple way to do this: make it routine and consistent to do lots of programming problems. I had started to do the ['daily programmer'](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) ones on reddit, I have to make this more consistent (how about 3 every week ?)



The other obvious way is to get into [TopCoder](www.topcoder.com). Go through all the [tutorials](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=alg_index), examples, every SRM that comes along. Even if it can't be attempted live, do it eventually.



So that's all for now. I'll evaluate this next year!
