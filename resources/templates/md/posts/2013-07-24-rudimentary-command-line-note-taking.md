Taking notes on the command line

===



Everyone has their own pet setup; here's mine. Its just a bunch of text files, shared on Dropbox.



I have a bash alias to make a directory if required, create the file, and open it in Vim.



Within the file, I use markdown for text, and a few additional conventions to make it easier to search through them.



I use one file per date, with the name being something like `~/notes/2013/07/24`.



The following one-liner in my `.bashrc` accomplishes this:



```shell

# Bring up the day's notes

function diary() {

  year=`date "+%Y"`

  month=`date "+%m"`

  day=`date "+%d"`

  diarydir=~/Dropbox/personalnotes/$year/$month

  if [[ ! -d "$diarydir" ]]; then

    mkdir -p "$diarydir"

  fi

  vi $diarydir/$day

}

```



I also use some additional _metadata_ within it, such as adding '@14:45' to indicate a timestamp before a paragraph, and '#category' to mark off sections (I use '##category' to denote one-line or one paragraph sections, otherwise all text is assumed to belong to the last declared section).



For convenience, I defined the following mapping in my ```.vimrc``` that inserts the timestamp when required:



```shell

nmap <C-c><C-t> o@<C-R>=strftime("%H:%M")<CR><CR><CR>

```



I'll cover the retrieval part of this in a separate post. If you don't have any note taking system yet, and don't want to go to the extent of _blogging_ every little thing you want to note down, and find it a bit of a hassle to open up Evernote or something similar to jot something down, you might like to try this quick and simple text-based solution!
