A lot of virtual ink has been spilled on whether R or Python is better suited to the needs of ["data scientists"](http://www.analyticbridge.com/profiles/blogs/the-death-of-the-statistician).



Numerous people (no, _evangelicals_) have weighed in [with](http://inside-bigdata.com/2013/12/09/data-science-wars-python-vs-r/) [their](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/25/python-displacing-r-as-the-programming-language-for-data-science) [polemics](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2013/11/26/python-r/) (summarized, briefly as "R is not really a language!", "Python is displacing R!", and "Will Python kill R?").



So, it's confusing (i.e., if you happen to care at all, though you don't have to; this is the internet, where the less people know or care about something, the stronger their opinions on it), but luckily someone did come up with a _data-driven approach_ to solving this problem. Check it out:

* Round 2 ([part 1](http://www.theswarmlab.com/r-vs-python-round-2/) and [part 2](http://www.theswarmlab.com/r-vs-python-round-2-22/))



Now you can _make up your own damn mind_.
