I will confess that I initially thought this was a big joke, some April Fool's Day kind of thing.



## WTF is Urbit ?



Supposedly it's an *"operating function"*. You could try reading the [FAQ](http://www.urbit.org/faq.html) but it's pretty sparse right now. Don't let that stop you from playing around with it though.



After watching the demo video (below), it seemed like something worth checking out.

Even if it isn't really *useful*, there's something to be learnt from what is clearly a well-thought-out, complex piece of work.



## Getting started



First, get some essential stuff.



```sh

sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev libsigsegv-dev openssl libssl-dev libncurses5-dev git make exuberant-ctags

```



Then get the source and build it.



```sh

$ git clone https://github.com/urbit/urbit.git

```



Add to your `.bashrc` the equivalent of



```sh

$ export URBIT_HOME=/home/agam/urbit/urb

```



and then



```sh

$ cd urbit

$ make

```



This will go on for a short while, and if all goes well, you should end up with a new `bin` subdirectory, with a single executable. Run it.



```sh

$ bin/vere 

vere: urbit home is /home/agam/urbit/urb

bin/vere: usage: [-v] [-k stage] computer

```



Excellently terse. Get used to it. It's also not exactly up-to-date. We're going to use a different parameter.



```sh

$ bin/vere -c frogstar

```



Obviously, substitute some made-up-name instead of `frogstar` above. Now you should see something like



```sh

$ bin/vere -c frogstar

vere: urbit home is /home/agam/urbit/urb

loom: mapped 1024MB

loading /home/agam/urbit/urb/urbit.pill

time: ~2014.1.6..07.34.20..58b0

ames: on localhost, UDP 44342.

generating 2048-bit RSA pair...

ames: czar zod.urbit.org: ip .198.199.112.32

saving passcode in /home/agam/.urbit/~fiddyn-lavpun.txt

(for real security, write it down and delete the file...)

; ~zod |Tianming| is your neighbor

; ~zod |Tianming| is your neighbor

waiting...

```



and after half a minute of waiting, it should download a whole bunch of `hoon` files ...



```sh

updating...

: /~wicmet-balful-tipdet-tardul--nisred-divpen-panref-sicbet/main/1/bin/update/hoon

: /~wicmet-balful-tipdet-tardul--nisred-divpen-panref-sicbet/main/1/bin/update/hoon

: /~wicmet-balful-tipdet-tardul--nisred-divpen-panref-sicbet/main/1/bin/update/hoon

: /~wicmet-balful-tipdet-tardul--nisred-divpen-panref-sicbet/main/1/bin/update/hoon

...

```



## Going off on an adventure!



At this point you should find yourself staring at the *`Arvo` prompt*



```sh

~wicmet-balful-tipdet-tardul--nisred-divpen-panref-sicbet/try=> 

```



(which, it turns out, is also a REPL)



That's all for now ... more on Urbit later.



Meanwhile, check out their website at [www.urbit.org](http://www.urbit.org/) or explore [the code on github](https://github.com/urbit/urbit) or follow them on twitter [@urbit_](https://twitter.com/urbit_).



Happy *urbiting* !!
