{:title "Importing old blog posts"

Having these old blogs lying around is a _pain_, so I took the first step in consolidating them, getting the source for my old _Hakyll_-based blog into Cryogen. 

Iâ€™ve tagged all these posts with `old-post`, and have yet to clean up the source, but the old content is (for better or worse!) now present alongside the newer stuff.
