There are many "teaching" languages, though a contender these days is harder to establish, given the amount of choice available. For very young kids, the Scratch[^1] framework is appropriate, while for slightly older kids, Python might be a better option.



I'd like to suggest another option (for slightly older kids), that might seem atypical at first: Go! Yes, I do believe the "Gopher language", used in many real production servers today, can realistically do double duty as a beginner language for kids.



This is the point where I make an analogy, and it goes something like this: I think Go can be to kids today what BASIC[^2] was to me[^3], i.e. as a way to experiment with and play around in a "text-mode" world, while getting very quick feedback, and building "complete" programs.



An objection many people have is along the lines of, "Oh no! You don't get it! Kids love _only_ flashy, shiny stuff! You need animation, and nothing else will do!" Perhaps several kids do; perhaps several adults do as well. These are not my target audience; I'll leave it at that.



No, I _do_ believe that many kids _will_ love the parameterized[^4] freedom offered, and learn to create and modify small Go programs. One of the _best_ sources of fun for me were old BASIC games books[^5], from where I used to type out entire[^6] programs (and then spend time fixing the inevitable typos that resulted).



Go has a simple syntax, that's easy to pick up (you can do a lot with just `int`s and `string`s!) and quick to run. All[^7] that remains to be done is to come up with a series of little games[^8], of increasing complexity and lots of fun.



_Statutory Warning: Heh, I'm just writing this in a burst of optimism (this might be a useless idea)._
