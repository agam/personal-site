Yeah it's been pretty _dry_ over here lately. Looks like the last post was on September 2, over _two months ago_. Many reasons, one of which is that I'm too lazy _even for Github pages_. Yes, I frequently cannot even be bothered to do something as simple as `rake new_post["Why I procrastinate endlessly: 20 reasons"]`.



Why, I ask myself, did I start using Jekyll/Octopress/GithubPages anyway?



1. The "cool factor". Don't care anymore.



2. Ease of use and maintenance. True, it's better than Wordpress, but this is a low bar.



3. Using markdown in posts. This was _the_ big reason, in hindsight. Three years ago there was _no_ other way to do this. Today, even Wordpress supports markdown out of the box.



Given all this, I don't see a reason (other than good code formatting) why I shouldn't just stay in [Ello](https://ello.co/agamb) instead.



_Update_: Nah, I really want to be able to separate the "code-related" stuff from other stuff to talk about. So this blog stays ...
