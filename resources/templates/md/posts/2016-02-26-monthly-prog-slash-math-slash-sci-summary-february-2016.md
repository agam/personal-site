I said I’d pick a better name, but I couldn’t, so I picked a _different_ name instead. Anyway, here is February’s badly curated list:



- You may have come across [TempleOS](http://www.templeos.org), one of those crazy things made by crazy people, and it looks like [_“LoseThos”_](http://web.archive.org/web/20060702135534/http://www.losethos.com/) was a predecessor (**note**: that it is available at all is due to the ever-amazing “Wayback Machine”)



> **You used to buy a computer to program. They didn't do much else**. LoseThos is intended for hobbiest programmers. A working knowledge of C programming is required. It more or less runs on least common denominator PC hardware without networking or the Internet. It is retro in some respects, having no security. As a programmer, I like having full access to my machine -- being able to turn-off interrupts or do direct disk block access. It is highly textual, so things can be scripted.  It boots fast, and you can power-off whenever you feel like, but just don't do it during disk writes.



- Someone pointed me to the [“Wolfram Programming Lab”](https://lab.open.wolframcloud.com/app/) … I’ve only looked at it superficially, but it might be a good alternative to _Scratch_, as an initial introduction to programming that “makes things happen”



- This is a theme that I like to share and re-share: Anil Dash talks about [“The Web We Lost”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KKMnoTTHJk) (tl;dr: **the internet we have is not the internet we were promised**)



- I was no fan of Robert Martin, perhaps because I wrongly associated him with excessive “bureaucracy” in software engineering, but it’s clear I was wrong, because [_this_](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/history-future-programming-languages) is a _great_ talk, and is one of the few people (other than, say, Alan Kay), who’ve made this connection between the changes in the “culture” of software development and its “popularization”.



- [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K13_sWm_gZw) by John McCarthy wasn’t particularly interesting, except for a choice quote that’s sure to offend certain “GPL fundamentalists” out there:



> I think that **Richard Stallman who has been a hero in many respects, has been a negative force in his view that anything/everything should be free and no one should have to pay for anything unless Stallman would think of a mechanism** … where my daughter who is a professional writer would still be able to make money.



- Daniel Spiewak talks about [“Living in a Post-Functional World”](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/post-functional-scala-clojure-haskell). I thought this would be meh, but turned out to be very insightful, and also indicates how close FP and OO really are. More to the point, **since modularity is non-negotiable, any solution to the problem of modularity drags in OO-ish stuff into an FP language**.



- Someone (thanks, @Beobachter!) suggested using [_Grav_](http://learn.getgrav.org/basics/what-is-grav), an intermediate alternative to a fully-static blog (what I have right now), and a fully-dynamic one (e.g. Wordpress), but I’ve been too lazy to investigate how to make the switch.



- Here is a (very, very humorous!) piece in The Register, [_”Learn you Func Prog on five minute quick!”_](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/13/stob_remember_the_monoids/)



> The object-oriented era of coding is at last drawing to an inevitable and shameful close. We can – and we must! – all join hands and skip gaily into a brave new world, where sloppy state and careless side effects are excised without ruth.



> Now every program, from humble Android applet to mighty engine-pollution-test-falsifier, must slough off ridiculous trappings and clumsy complexities of objectivity, and float elegantly forwards down the shiny new functional pipeline – the one, true alimentary canal of code to concurrent computing paradise.



And so on.



- Finally, Gilad Bracha’s [new book](http://www.amazon.com/Dart-Programming-Language-Gilad-Bracha/dp/0321927702?tag=duckduckgo-osx-20) is very enticing; I’ve placed it on my “soon-to-read-unless-I’m-lying-to-myself-about-my-available-free-time” list, and so should you.
