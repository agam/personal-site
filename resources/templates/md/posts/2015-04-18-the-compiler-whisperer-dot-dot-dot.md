Came acros this comment by Knuth in [these slides](http://cr.yp.to/talks/2015.04.16/slides-djb-20150416-a4.pdf):



> We found ourselves always running up against the same problem: the compiler needs to be in a dialog with the programmer; it needs to know properties of the data, and whether certain cases can arise, etc. And we couldnâ€™t think of a good language in which to have such a dialog.



Sounds an awful lot like a SLIME session.
