For the last month, I've been trying out various programming languages, as a sort of extended "Programming Language Zoo" experience. My inability to like any one of them and commit to it is depressing, but I made a few Gists out of the initial steps I followed for each of them, so hopefully a less indecisive person who knows what they want to do might benefit.



Some of these are different implementations of a language; a couple of these are specific libraries within a language and meant for OSX; the rest are all targeted for a Linux machine, assuming an Emacs editor/interface.



(Included here are `SBCL`, `Clozure`, `Ocaml`, `Clojure`, `Quil`, `Overtone`, `Haskell`, `Fsharp`, `Shen`, `Dart`)
