I'm excitedly looking forward to Kernighan's [new book](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/). But more than that, I'm _very_ happy that the "Go rocket" has now definitively cleared the launchpad -- and predictably, heads are exploding all over that great bastion of PL hipsterdom, [_Hacker News_](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9150163).



As an aside, the Reddit community seems way more mature and not react predictably all the time. See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2y105x/the_go_programming_language_by_brian_w_kernighan/) thread, which is really a humorous meta-comment on all such discussions:



- \<generic rant about generics\>

- \<simplistic response about how Go is simple\>

---  _No generics means reading the code is easier, somehow!_

- **\<snarky response about Rust's superiority\>**

- \<attempt to shoehorn D into the conversation\>

- \<link to article explaining monads\>

- \<web scale node.js\>

- \<We are the Knights who say NIM!\>



Anyway, all I know so far is the [Table of Contents](http://www.informit.com/store/go-programming-language-9780134190440#bss0f8fc8f7-6d8d-4816-9b68-458cbd7149e6), but stay tuned for more!
