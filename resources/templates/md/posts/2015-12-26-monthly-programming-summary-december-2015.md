A second installment of "interesting stuff I came across this month" ...



(_Aside:_ I shouldn't call this a "programming" summary, but I can't think of anything better -- it's more of a "math + science + computers" newsletter)



- The highlight of the last month for me was the realization of the dream of an ultra-cheap computer, the [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero/), which is cheaper than several drinks at Starbucks.



- Yes, ants displaying "collective intelligence" is old stuff (I first encountered a reference to it in the pages of _Godel, Escher, Bach_), but [this article](http://www.kurzweilai.net/army-ants-living-bridges-suggest-collective-intelligence) is something else altogether, showing how "living bridges" are dynamically adjusted by the constituent ants, in response to foraaging needs.



- _"Get Lamp"_ ([link to trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwZxUGmqSOo)) is an interesting documentary on the history of interactive text-based fiction, mostly adventure games. If you've ever telneted to a MUD, you will like this.



- I lap up everything by Bret Victor, and hope for him to turn out as the Alan Kay of our time. [This](https://medium.com/re-form/the-utopian-ui-architect-34dead42a28#.emrat4pnv) is aanother recent piece where he insists we haven't really _used_ computers well at all.



- Finally, [this Popular Mechanics article](http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a18343/the-cannons-on-the-b-29-bomber-were-a-mid-century-engineering-masterpiece/) blew me away -- before there were "real" computers, the B-29 Superfortress had high-tech computing _way_ ahead of its time, to remotely operate its gun turrets.

This month's QOTM is from Bret Victor's piece above:



> Now we’re staring at computer screens and moving our hands on a keyboard, but it’s basically the same thing. **We’re computer users thinking paper thoughts.”**
