Found a nice tutorial covering basic web servers/handlers/database interaction in Go, in [two](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2017/09/13/how-to-build-a-web-application-in-golang/) [parts](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2017/10/18/golang-adding-database-to-web-application/).

Wish there were more like this, or as well done. It was easy (_and fun!_) to [follow along.](https://bitbucket.org/agambrahma/golangfullstack/src/master/)
