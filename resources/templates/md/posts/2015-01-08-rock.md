I've been having some fun with the idea of simple text-based games in Go[^1]. The original BASIC games book[^2] was not hard to find, and it was interesting to revisit it again.



The first thing that stared me in the face was just how _bad_ (and by "bad" I mean _incomprehensible_) most of the code was. In my nostalgia I had completely lost sight of this.



The second thing was how nicely self-contained each game was, focussed on one simple idea, and implicitly pedagogical. Indeed, the games can be divided into a few distinct families[^3].



So I came up with a hypothetical organization for my hypothetical book -- it would need some simple stuff to start out with (with for loops, conditionals, functions, and so on), and slowly introduce more stuff. _An explicit non-goal_ would be teaching the language in its complete form (a link to _Effective Go_[^4] should suffice for the motivated reader).



In terms of Games, the rough plan I came up with was: start with some simple guessing game, then maybe a slightly more involved version, then a card game, then the classic _Battleship_ around the mid-point, followed by a sort of _"dungeon RPG"_ with some optional discussion at each point (e.g. should the computer in "Battleship" be dumb and random, or _learn_?)



To get an idea of what this might look like, I wrote the first four of these. Here is what might pass for the very first one, a modified version of _"Rock, Paper, Scissors"_.



```go

package main



import (

	"fmt"

	"math/rand"

	"strings"

	"time"

)



const (

	rock = iota

	paper

	scissors

	lizard

	spock

	maxOptions

)



var handOptions = []string{"rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "spock"}



type precedence struct {

	hand1  int

	reason string

	hand2  int

}



var precedences = []precedence{

	{spock, "smashes", scissors},

	{spock, "vaporises", rock},

	{lizard, "posions", spock},

	{lizard, "eats", paper},

	{rock, "crushes", lizard},

	{rock, "cruses", scissors},

	{paper, "covers", rock},

	{paper, "disproves", spock},

	{scissors, "cuts", paper},

	{scissors, "decapitates", lizard},

}



func showUsage() {

	fmt.Println("\n     Welcome to ROCK - PAPER - SCISSORS - LIZARD - SPOCK  ")

	fmt.Println("----------------------------------------------------------\n")

	fmt.Println("We each pick one of the following : \n")

	for i := 0; i < maxOptions; i++ {

		fmt.Printf("-->  %s  <--\n", handOptions[i])

	}

	fmt.Println()

}



func getPlayerChoice() int {

	for {

		fmt.Printf("\nEnter your choice : ")

		var choice string

		fmt.Scan(&choice)



		choice = strings.ToLower(choice)



		for i := 0; i < maxOptions; i++ {

			if handOptions[i] == choice {

				return i

			}

		}

	}

}



func getComputerChoice() (choice int) {

	choice = rand.Intn(maxOptions)

	fmt.Printf("I chose ")

	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {

		fmt.Printf(".")

		time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond)

	}

	fmt.Printf(" %s\n\n", handOptions[choice])

	return

}



func main() {

	showUsage()



	rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())

	var playerWins, computerWins int



	for {

		fmt.Printf("\nThe score is: Me %d, You %d\n", computerWins, playerWins)

		playerChoice := getPlayerChoice()

		computerChoice := getComputerChoice()



		playerWon := false

		computerWon := false

		for _, p := range precedences {

			if p.hand1 == playerChoice && p.hand2 == computerChoice {

				fmt.Printf("Alas! %s %s %s! You Win! :(\n",

					handOptions[p.hand1], p.reason, handOptions[p.hand2])

				playerWon = true

			}

			if p.hand1 == computerChoice && p.hand2 == playerChoice {

				fmt.Printf("Aha! %s %s %s! I win! :)\n",

					handOptions[p.hand1], p.reason, handOptions[p.hand2])

				computerWon = true

			}

		}



		if playerWon {

			playerWins++

		} else if computerWon {

			computerWins++

		} else {

			fmt.Println("Hey, look, it was a draw!\n\n")

		}



		fmt.Printf("\nPlay another round ?  (enter 'y' or 'n') : ")

		var another string

		fmt.Scan(&another)

		if strings.ToLower(another) == "y" {

			continue

		} else {

			break

		}

	}

	fmt.Println("\nOh well, until next time then ... \n")

}

```



Try it out! It's meant to be simple and straightforward -- but wait! Before you pass judgement, I present to you the _original_ version:



```basic

10 PRINT TAB(21);"GAME OF ROCK, SCISSORS, PAPER"

20 PRINT TAB(15);"CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY"

25 PRINT:PRINT:PRINT

30 INPUT "HOW MANY GAMES";Q

40 IF Q<11 THEN 60

50 PRINT "SORRY, BUT WE AREN'T ALLOWED TO PLAY THAT MANY.": GOTO 30

60 FOR G=1 TO Q

70 PRINT: PRINT "GAME NUMBER";G

80 X=INT(RND(1)*3+1)

90 PRINT "3=ROCK...2=SCISSORS...1=PAPER"

100 INPUT "1...2...3...WHAT'S YOUR CHOICE";K

110 IF (K-1)*(K-2)*(K-3)<>0 THEN PRINT "INVALID.": GOTO 90

120 PRINT "THIS IS MY CHOICE..."

130 ON X GOTO 140,150,160

140 PRINT "...PAPER": GOTO 170

150 PRINT "...SCISSORS": GOTO 170

160 PRINT "...ROCK"

170 IF X=K THEN 250

180 IF X>K THEN 230

190 IF X=1 THEN 210

200 PRINT "YOU WIN!!!":H=H+1: GOTO 260

210 IF K<>3 THEN 200

220 PRINT "WOW!  I WIN!!!":C=C+1:GOTO 260

230 IF K<>1 OR X<>3 THEN 220

240 GOTO 200

250 PRINT "TIE GAME.  NO WINNER."

260 NEXT G

270 PRINT: PRINT "HERE IS THE FINAL GAME SCORE:"

280 PRINT "I HAVE WON";C;"GAME(S)."

290 PRINT "YOU HAVE WON";H;"GAME(S)."

300 PRINT "AND";Q-(C+H);"GAME(S) ENDED IN A TIE."

310 PRINT: PRINT "THANKS FOR PLAYING!!"

320 END

```



Yes, folks, that is the kind of stuff I _cannot_ believe I squinted over and read again and again :(
