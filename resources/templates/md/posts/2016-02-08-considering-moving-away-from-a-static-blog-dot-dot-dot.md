{:title "considering moving away from a static blog dot dot dot"

This blog has been my longest continuous online presence (beginning as a _Hakyll_ blog in 2012 before switching to _Jekyll_ (well, _Octopress_) about a year later). I liked the whole "edit in markdown in a terminal and use `git` for everything" flow.



Unfortunately, time is scarcer now, my free time is less structured, and I often find myself away from an actual terminal, though equipped with a capable smartphone. For my [more-general-purpose blog](https://abacusnoirform.wordpress.com), I used Wordpress and it's worked out pretty well so far, because I can "write on the go", and I'd like to be able to do the same for this blog too.



So I haven't decided exactly how and when to migrate (because hey, I do want to keep what I have) to a "dynamic blog" (funny phrase, that), but I definitely want to do it sometime this year.
