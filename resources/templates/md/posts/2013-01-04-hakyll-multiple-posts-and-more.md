Handling multiple posts, and more

========================================



At the moment, my blog is basically a single page. This is boring, so let's expand it to handle multiple pages. Also, each page should be templatized in turn, so that we can add a footer to handle analytics, comments, etc.



Multiple posts

--------------------



I'll do this step by step. First, I'll ignore the index page and just add support for the posts. So `blog.hs` gets a new "match" rule.



```haskell

    match "posts/*" $ do

        route     $ setExtension "html"

        compile   $ pageCompiler

            >>> applyTemplateCompiler "templates/post.html"

            >>> relativizeUrlsCompiler

```



I modified `index.markdown` to explicitly point to the two posts for now (i.e. this one and the previous one).



Also, I created `templates/post.html`, which has some basic boilerplate difference from the template used to serve the index page :-



```html

        <h1>$$title$$</h1>

	<br>

	<h2>$$date$$</h2>

	<br>



        $$body$$

```



Ok, `ghc --make blog.hs && ./blog preview` confirms that all is well.



Analytics and Comments

-------------------------



I'll be brief here, since you probably already know this, and this isn't relevant to hakyll in anyway. There are many commenting systems out there, I found [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com) to be really quick to set up.



Enter your username, password, site url, and you'll be shown a list of hosting platforms; just select *Universal Code* from the list, then copy-paste the javascript into the html footer of your post template. Done. Your posts now have comments!



Similarly, if you want to track site visits, [Google Analytics](www.google.com/analytics/) is a quick solution. Sign up for a new account, enter the website name, and then get your "tracking code", which is a bit of javascript you (again) tack on to the end of each post's html.



Showing a list of posts

-------------------------



At a minimum, we'd like to show the last few posts on the index page, and provide a link to the list of *all* posts.



Let's do the second item first. To do this, we'll create a pseudo-page that will be defined based on the list of posts found in the `posts/` subdirectory.



(BTW this is heavily ~~inspired by~~ copy-pasted from [this hakyll example](https://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll-examples/blob/master/feedblog/hakyll.hs))



Since we want to have a 'list of posts' on the index page as well, this common functionality can be abstracted out.



```haskell

addPostList :: Compiler (Page String, [Page String]) (Page String)

addPostList = setFieldA "posts" $

    arr (reverse . chronological)

        >>> require "templates/postitem.html" (\p t -> map (applyTemplate t) p)

        >>> arr mconcat

        >>> arr pageBody

```



Now create a rudimentary html fragment that will hold the 'post summary'



```html

<li>

   <a href="$ url $">$ title $</a> - <em>$ date $</em>

</li>

```



Finally, to tie it together, add a match for `posts.html`, which will be the entry point to show the list of all posts.



```haskell

    match "posts.html" $ route idRoute 

    create "posts.html" $ constA mempty

        >>> arr (setField "title" "All posts")

        >>> requireAllA "posts/*" addPostList

        >>> applyTemplateCompiler "templates/posts.html"

        >>> applyTemplateCompiler "templates/default.html"

        >>> relativizeUrlsCompiler

```



Showing a subset of all posts on the index page

--------------------------------------------------



Initially, I had some trouble getting this to work, for some reason the ```match "posts/*"``` wasn't working, and I commented out the ```match "index.html"``` and retained the ```index.markdown``` that I had.



Turned out to be another ommission on my part, I had to replace



```haskell

	match "index.html" $ do

	create "index.html" $ constA mempty

```



with



```haskell

	match "index.html" $ route idRoute

	create "index.html" $ constA mempty

```



... and then it works!



Getting the list of the last (say) 3 posts is achieved by having a line similar to the one in the handler for ```posts.html```, except instead of just



```haskell

	>>> requireAllA "posts/*" addPostList

```



we now have



```haskell

        >>> requireAllA "posts/*" (id *** arr (take 3 . reverse . chronological) >>> addPostList)

```



CSS-ifying

-----------



You probably know more about this than me, but if you don't want a black-and white, crammed together bunch of text, you probably want atleast a couple of css rules for your headers and the body text etc. I cobbled together mine based on some random examples I found online, pick yours as you see fit.
