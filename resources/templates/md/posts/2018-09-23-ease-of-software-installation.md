If you had told me ten years ago that it would be simpler and quicker to install any new open source tools/languages/frameworks on OSX than Linux, I would have laughed.

Yet here we are. _Anything_ I need is a `brew install` away on my MacBook, but if I need to set it up in an Ubuntu environment, I need to figure out whether I can “just” `apt-get` it, or whether I need a custom `ppa`, or whether I need to get the `.deb`, or whether I just have to build from source.

I routinely notice this in the install instructions, where the OSX section is one-line, and the Linux section is split into Fedora, Arch, and _maybe_  Ubuntu/Debian.

I know there are Good Reasons (tm) for this, but … it’s still surprising.
