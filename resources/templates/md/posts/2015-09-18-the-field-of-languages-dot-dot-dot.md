Last year, I spent some time trying out Haskell, Ocaml, Clojure, Dart, Shen, and ClozureCL. I thought I was done surveying the field, but I had barely scratched the surface, and realizing this was quite depressing. There are entire _kinds_ of language paradigms I have no experience of, such as:



- **Forth**: All I've done is read about people's experience with it, it has always seemed too alien to me.

- **Smalltalk**: I installed Pharo and took the basic "Prof. Stef" tutorial, but then stopped before I could really try anything concrete.

- **APL/J**: Never seemed like anything but line noise, but then I read [this post on J](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/a-look-at-the-j-language-the-fine-line-between-genius-and-insanity/) and saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlM9BXfu7UY) on Dyalog, and I'm curious about it
