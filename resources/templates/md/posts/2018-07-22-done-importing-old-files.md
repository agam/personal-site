Wrote a small script to bring in all the content from my earlier Hugo site, so I have everything now! I still need to find to go and clean up some of the old stuff, there are the usual text formatting bugs. But for the first time, I have all the content in one place, which is _great_.

Also, I should think about "what goes here?", it's true I don't get a lot of time these days for just mucking around ... but there are still plenty of little experiments and ideas that have to go _somewhere_, and this is where they belong.
