Ok, I've been talked back off the ledge. Perhaps I over-reacted a bit when I fled to [Tumblr](http://agamposts.tumblr.com/) and then to Wordpress.



I will undo some of that and continue living here for a while. Until the next catastrophe, I suppose. Or maybe I won't call it that.



So I'll move a couple of the posts I created there back here and delete that blog.
