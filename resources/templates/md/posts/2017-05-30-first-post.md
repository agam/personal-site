### Trying out Cryogen

Re-activating a static-blog/website, this would be sort of _version 4_ (after previous instances of static blogs in `Hakyll`, `Jekyll`, `Hugo` and a plain HTML single-page site).

For now, the only existing content is the ["About me"](pages-output/about/) page, but I might dump snippets and little notes here in the future.
