Hakyll transition

=================



I noticed that the dates in my blog were all wrong, and now the blog

doesn't build.



```shell

ghc --make blog.hs

[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( blog.hs, blog.o )



blog.hs:27:12:

    Not in scope: `list'

    Perhaps you meant `last' (imported from Prelude)



blog.hs:29:21: Not in scope: `pageCompiler'



blog.hs:30:17: Not in scope: `applyTemplateCompiler'



blog.hs:31:17: Not in scope: `relativizeUrlsCompiler'



blog.hs:34:27:

    Not in scope: `constA'

    Perhaps you meant `const' (imported from Prelude)



blog.hs:35:18: Not in scope: `setField'



blog.hs:36:13: Not in scope: `requireAllA'



blog.hs:37:13: Not in scope: `applyTemplateCompiler'



blog.hs:38:13: Not in scope: `applyTemplateCompiler'



blog.hs:39:13: Not in scope: `relativizeUrlsCompiler'



blog.hs:43:21: Not in scope: `pageCompiler'



blog.hs:44:17: Not in scope: `applyTemplateCompiler'



blog.hs:45:17: Not in scope: `applyTemplateCompiler'



blog.hs:46:17: Not in scope: `relativizeUrlsCompiler'

```



The price to pay for using a system in flux ... oh well, time to read up on

the [hakyll

transition](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/04-compilers.html) from v3 to v4.



Alright, that isn't good enough ... need some 'patterns' to work with.

Luckily, I found [another Hakyll blog](http://wmasson.com/) that made the jump, and shameless

plagiarized. (So thank you, ```wmasson```!)



Well, I didn't even plagiarize well. I used tabs instead of spaces at one

point and stared at a ```parse error on input `='``` error message for

_some time_.



I spent some more time staring at



```

blog.hs:39:47:

    Couldn't match expected type `Item String'

                with actual type `[Item String]'

    Expected type: [Item String] -> [Item String]

      Actual type: [Item String] -> [[Item String]]

    In the second argument of `(.)', namely `recentFirst'

    In the second argument of `($)', namely `take 3 . recentFirst'

```



... and then I realized that the signature of ```postList``` was wrong and should have its second argument as ```([Item String] -> Compiler [Item String])``` instead of ```([Item String] -> [Item String])```.

Had to change ```prep <$> loadAll pattern``` to ```prep =<< loadAll pattern``` to accomodate this change.



Somehow the type signature of the main page function didn't match, so I modified the ```postList``` function to take a ```listmodifier```; this way I could pass in ```id``` for the list of all posts and ```(take 3)``` for the main page.



I also had to change the date format from ```%d %m %Y``` to ```%Y-%m-%d```, since I was getting an



```

[ERROR] Hakyll.Web.Template.Context.getItemUTC: could not parse time for ...

```



error message, looking at the [source](https://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll/blob/master/src/Hakyll/Web/Template/Context.hs#L200) I found that only a few formats were supported.



Finally, right at the end, I clobbered the git submodule in my output directory when I did a ```./blog rebuild```. So to bring it back, I had to



```shell

$ rm -f .gitmodules

$ ./blog clean

Removing _site...

Removing _cache...

Removing _cache/tmp...

$ git rm -r _site

rm '_site'

$ git submodule add --force git@github.com:agam/agam.github.com.git _site

Reactivating local git directory for submodule '_site'.

$ cd _site

$ git checkout master

$ cd ..

$ ./blog build

```



So ... no outward change in appearance, but a lot of time wasted, and all because I was bold enough to run ```cabal update```.



Yes, I know. Sad.



But it works! (atleast the chronological sorting works again).



_**Update:**_ [This diff](https://github.com/agam/hakyll-source/commit/9af1c492dc34e2ffb677a619ac86113a8a716703) might help to show the changes required.

_**Update:**_ Just for fun, I tweaked the CSS of the page a bit, to make it a little less bland.
