{:title "The end of static blogging (for now)" :layout :post :tags ["meta"]}

I won't repeat everything I mentioned [here](https://abacusnoirform.blog/2019/05/20/continuing-thoughts-about-the-static-blog/), but essentially:

- No more separate Wordpress + static blog
- Everything that would normally belong here should show up in [the _Programming_ category](https://abacusnoirform.blog/category/programming/) there
- Any code snippets should show up in [repl.it](https://abacusnoirform.blog/category/programming/), any notebook-type stuff in [nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/)

P.S. Honorary mention/thanks though: I have really _enjoyed_ using [*Netlify*](https://www.netlify.com) that past few months, and if there was the slightest possibilty of having a static site for _anything_, that is what I would use. It makes _no_ sense to do any build/checkout/deploy from a terminal anymore, I'm writing _this post_ inside the Github editor, and ... that's all I need to do to post it, because _everything else_ is handled by Netlify!
