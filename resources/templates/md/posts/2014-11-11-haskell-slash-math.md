I don't recall the very first articles I might have read about Haskell, but the first non-short text was Real World Haskell, which I went through the year it came out. I didn't write any code at that time (a mistake!)



Then, a coupffle of years later, I thought I'd try my hand at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) with Haskell. I did the first 10-15 and then got bored. 



_Another_ couple of years later, I decided to "try it out" again. This time, it was by starting a static blog (this one!) in [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), and disassembling some trivial programs. This also didn't last, and after my initial brush with "[cabal](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal/Survival) [hell](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2014/09/how-we-might-abolish-cabal-hell-part-1/)", I switched to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) instead.



I poked around with [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/) and its various ["shakespearean"](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shakespeare) plugins, and gave that up too.



At one point I found myself asking the question: "Why am I doing this in Haskell at all?" And the answer, obviously, was that (of course!) I _didn't need to_. So I lost interest altogether. 



Now I realize these were all misguided efforts. What I should have done was to approach the whole thing from a more _fundamental_ plane, the way SICP introduces Scheme. So, I've decided to make my way through [The Haskell Road to Maths, Logic and Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Haskell-Programming-Second-Edition-Computing/dp/0954300696), trying as hard as I can to _not_ let preconceived notions filter through, and to take it all in with a "beginner's mind".



It's going to be a while :)

_P.S. Emacs support for Haskell is pretty sweet. Here's a n00b-level screenshot showing a "SLIME-style" ghci session_

**Update:** Someone suggested I should read _a more recent_ book, [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/book.html) by Graham Hutton, so I guess I'll do that first.
