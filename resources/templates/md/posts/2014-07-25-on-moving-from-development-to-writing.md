From [Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/confessions-of-an-ex-developer/). I have to say I've been feeling the same way for some time now!



> We’ve had our (latest) software Renaissance in the form of the mobile platforms and their App Stores, and I think the software biz is now starting to slide back towards consolidation and mega-corps again. _It’s not a particularly great time to be an indie app developer anymore._



> Small shops are closing. Three-person companies are dropping back to sole proprietorships all over the place. Products are being acquired every week, usually just for their development teams, and then discarded.



> **The implacable, crushing wheels of industry, slow to move because of their size, have at last arrived on the frontier**. Our frontier, or at least yours now. I’ve relinquished my claim.
