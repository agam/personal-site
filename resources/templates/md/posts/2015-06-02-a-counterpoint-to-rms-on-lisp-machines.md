You might have come across Richard Stallman's [brief history of Lisp Machines](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html), which was a speech he gave in 2002. I remember coming across it -- being inspired by what inspired him, and being outraged at what outraged him.



Lately, I'm souring on the whole _romantic_ view of the "free software" that I'd held for about a decade, a distinctly "NoGPL" view, if I may coin that word. Another nail in the coffin was delivered by [this blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20090901115039/http://danweinreb.org/blog/rebuttal-to-stallmans-story-about-the-formation-of-symbolics-and-lmi) [^1], which refutes much of the blame to Symbolics, and leaves Stallman looking IMO quite silly (if not petulant).



Also ...



> And while Iâ€™m setting the record straight, the original (TECO-based) Emacs was created and designed by Guy L. Steele Jr. and David Moon. **After they had it working, and it had become established as the standard text editor at the AI lab, Stallman took over its maintenance.**



... so much for RMS's _"But, along the way, I wrote a text editor, Emacs ..."_.
