A second installment of "interesting stuff I came across this month" ...



- A 1972 article in Rolling Stone magazine by Stewart Brand: [_"Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums"_](http://www.wheels.org/spacewar/stone/rolling_stone.html). If only the present had corresponded a little closer to the imagined future of the past, eh? :)



> The hackers are the technicians of this science - _“It’s a term of derision and also the ultimate compliment.”_ They are the ones who translate human demands into code that the machines can understand and act on. They are legion. **Fanatics with a potent new toy**. A mobile new-found elite, with its own apparat, language and character, its own legends and humor. Those magnificent men with their flying machines, scouting a leading edge of technology which has an odd softness to it; outlaw country, where rules are not decree or routine so much as the starker demands of what’s possible.



- An excellent blog that was forced offline by vociferous commentors, but lives on in the depths of the Wayback Machine: [_"Surely I am Joking"_](http://web.archive.org/web/20140107054458/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/) by Yin Wang. _All_ the posts are good, my favorites are the ones on the downsides of "pure" FP and "pure" OOP (and [how the two are similar!](http://web.archive.org/web/20140116155929/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/oop-fp)), the one on [_"what is a program?"_](http://web.archive.org/web/20131127131340/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2012/09/16/what-is-a-program/), and the one on the [_"dark age of programming"_](http://web.archive.org/web/20140103011845/http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/database/).



- A 1987 article in _"Computer Language"_ magazine: [_"Mutant languages from the LISP lab"_](http://bit-player.org/wp-content/extras/bph-publications/CompLang-1987-04-Hayes-mutant-lisps.pdf) -- just for fun, and an insight into the pre-Common Lisp era.



- A humorous blog entry from 2009: [_"A Brief, Incomplete, and Mostly Wrong History of Programming Languages"_](http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html), with a self-explanatory title.



And finally, a "quote-of-the-month". This one is short and succinct _Perlisism_:



> **Computer Science is embarrassed by the computer.**
