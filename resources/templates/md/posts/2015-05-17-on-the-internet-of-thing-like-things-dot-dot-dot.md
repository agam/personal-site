Went to Maker Faire, had my mind blown _(as usual)_, and then came across this quote[^1] by Cory Doctorow:



> So today we have marketing departments who say things like ‘[…] Make me a computer that doesn’t run every program, just a program that does this specialized task, like streaming audio, or routing packets, or playing Xbox games’ […] But that’s not what we do when we turn a computer into an appliance. We’re not making a computer that runs only the “appliance” app; we’re making a computer that can run every program, but which uses some combination of rootkits, spyware, and code-signing to prevent the user from knowing which processes are running, from installing her own software, and from terminating processes that she doesn’t want. **In other words, an appliance is not a stripped-down computer — it is a fully functional computer with spyware on it out of the box.**
