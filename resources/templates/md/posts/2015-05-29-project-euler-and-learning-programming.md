I started doing Project Euler problems occasionally with the assumption that it was a good way to either (1) learn a new language, or (2) as a healthy way to keep practicing programming. It turns out, however, that what I _really_ end up doing is "brute-forcing" problems that are really _math_ problems.



So while I really should continue, I should do so by learning more math, instead of banging away at bad implementations. When I looked around for options for these, I realized that (as in so many other things) we're spoilt for choice! Options abound, ranging from the "Daily Programmer" [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer), to dedicated (_free!_) practice sites like [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or [CoderByte](http://coderbyte.com/).



Eventually I just picked one at random and decided to start doing roughly one problem a day (I picked [CodeWars](https://www.hackerrank.com/), which has an amusing "dojo" feel to it). We'll see how long it lasts :)



**Edit**: There is a bigger list of "coding challenge" sites [here](http://codecondo.com/coding-challenges/).
