{:title "Emacs & building a second brain"

Pure Storage, where I work, has been hosting a Bay Area _Emacs_ meet up (two of them so far). Normally, the way these things are, I pretty much expect everyone to have some software engineering background; that’s usually the _only_ reason to want that much _power_ in what most people consider a “mere text editor”. 

So I was really surprised (in a pleasant way!) to encounter a departure from the norm. In the last meetup, the main presentation was by someone who _wasn’t_ a software engineer, and was actually a … monk!

Emacs being emacs, this was about a sort of super-charged org-mode++ type system he had built within Emacs, patterned after the [_Building a second brain_](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com) (which I hadn't heard of before his talk, but makes a lot of sense now) idea. It turns out he had a friend in a computer science program who introduced him to Emacs (and, incidentally, Clojure!)

You can see some of the slides and more details about this system [_here_](https://medium.com/@tasshin/implementing-a-second-brain-in-emacs-and-org-mode-ef0e44fb7ca5), but I was more interested in the non-programming part and the speaker’s background. There were some very (I felt) insightful comments about the interplay of _wisdom_, _love_ and _power_, and how these are expressed in Emacs (!) It was just a very, very, very … _surreal_ meetup.
