{:title "logic through haskell not necessarily dot dot dot"

Finished reading (browsing, really, after the first few chapters) through The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming[^1], and I am ... _underwhelmed_. I mean the book was great and all, but maybe I made the mistake of forming some unreasonable expectations.



If you're already familiar with a bit of Haskell and basic logic/sets/numbers, you'll get the most _bang for your buck_ from Chapter 10 on _Corecursion_[^2]. This was "brand new" for me and I had multiple "aha" moments after seeing the mechanism used to reason about non-deterministic processes etc.



**Conclusions**:



- More than Haskell, this motivated me to learn more math (though I don't know _where to start_!)

- I feel like Mathematica could be used too, for everything in this book; for stuff like this it's like Haskell _plus lots of libraries and visualization_
