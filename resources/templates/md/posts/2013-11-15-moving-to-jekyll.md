Moving to Jekyll

================



Wait, what ? Seriously ? Yes, seriously.



If it goes well you're reading this on my Jekyll-generated static blog (or

perhaps [something else](http://www.tumblr.com)). In that case, you should know

that this post and the ones before it were generated by [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). It was fun, I made my point, but I have a general _be-more-practical-than-ideological_ theme going in my life, and this is part of that.
