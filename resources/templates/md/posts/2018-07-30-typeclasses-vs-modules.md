I still haven’t fully grokked a good comparison here, how does one map onto another (if at all), what are the tradeoffs of one versus the other. On a similar note, how do I compare the tradeoffs of _Higher-Kinded Types_ (Haskell) vs _Higher-Polymorphic Types_ (OCaml)?

Found a bunch of stuff to read about this, but my head is no clearer. Maybe someone out there can explain it to me one day.
