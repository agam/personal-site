I’ve had a Coursera account for a while, and have watched videos for lots of courses over time, but never really “took them seriously”, i.e. I didn’t actively do assignments, follow deadlines etc.

This year I decided (since I anyway have very little time on hand), to sample Andrew Ng’s new “Deep Learning Specialization”.

I had watched the ML course videos from way back, but had found that too boring. The exercises in Matlab didn’t feel like fun, and I didn’t feel like we were doing anything, and didn’t see it through.

This time felt very different, and part of it was no doubt the Jupyter notebooks, which really raise the bar on an interactive course experience.

Also, the material is laid out very well, and things follow each other in a sequence that makes it very easy to follow along without forgetting anything.

Just finished the first two courses, and debating taking the rest.
