I liked this quote from the ["Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming"](http://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Techniques-Models-Computer-Programming/dp/0262220695):



> Programming as defined above has two essential parts: a technology and its scientific foundation.



> The technology consists of tools, practical techniques, and

standards, allowing us to do programming.



> The science consists of a broad and deep theory with predictive power, allowing us to understand programming. _Ideally, the science should explain the technology in a way that is as direct and useful as possible._



> If either part is left out, we are no longer doing programming. **Without the

technology, we are doing pure mathematics. Without the science, we are doing a

craft, i.e., we lack deep understanding**
