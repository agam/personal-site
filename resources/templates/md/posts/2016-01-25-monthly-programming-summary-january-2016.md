Again, this isn’t really restricted to _Programming_ per se, but more generally “computer-related stuff”. Next time, I’ll pick a better name. Until then, here are a few interesting links I came across last month, in no  particular order:



- The Handbook of Lisp Functions (cover page below): a [technical report](http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/mblisp/Handbook_of_LISP_Functions.pdf) from _1961_.

- Digression on learning new languages: Ugh, I’m too embarassed to even write this. I keep changing my mind about what I like more. I thought this was going to be “the year of Clojure” for me, but then [Gilad Bracha’s book](http://www.amazon.com/Dart-Programming-Language-Gilad-Bracha/dp/0321927702#) came out and now I’m torn again (Can I have them _both_? Maybe, but I fear I don’t have that kind of time anymore :P)



- Busting the myths behind MicroKernels: [_”Microkernels are slow and Elvis didn’t do no drugs”_](http://blog.darknedgy.net/technology/2016/01/01/0/)



- Here is a paper from 1982 ([_”The Architecture of the Burroughs B5000 - 20 Years Later and Still Ahead of the Times?”_](http://www.smecc.org/The%20Architecture%20%20of%20the%20Burroughs%20B-5000.htm)), which was _even then_ lamenting the sorry state of hardware, and only seems quaint now (as in _”why would you do things different?”_)



- Various ways to make Clojure programming more productive: [_”Pimp My REPL”_](http://dev.solita.fi/2014/03/18/pimp-my-repl.html)



- I had a bunch of entertaining blog posts by Crista Lopez in the past (e.g. [_”Jedi Masters”_](http://tagide.com/blog/fiction/jedi-masters/)), but was blown away by this set of slides. You’re a programmer, you want to be a programmer for life, you _have_ to read this: [_”Exercises in Programming Style”_](http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-aar-2013/slides/CristinaVideiraLopes_ExercisesInStyle.pdf). And if you really like it, [get the book](http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371).



- Came across this intriguing indie film trailer ([_”TraceRoute”_](https://vimeo.com/147111732)), though I haven’t gotten around to seeing the movie yet (the writer/protagonist navigates “… the ghosts of nerddom’s past present and future …”). Dunno, added it to my “to watch” list.



- Obviously, the X-Files is back. If you like this sort of stuff, the first episode [is free to watch](http://www.fox.com/watch/607308867569/7756658688) on Fox. Go watch it :)



- A couple of articles for “historical interest”. The first is the New York Times reporting on … [the opening of its web site, in 1996!](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/22/business/the-new-york-times-introduces-a-web-site.html). But really, you skip ahead to the very last line for your dose of irony-or-tragedy: _“The market is booming for newspapers on the World Wide Web”_. Ouch.



- The second is hilarious, from even further back ([_”Value of Windowing is Questioned”_](http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/25/science/value-of-windowing-is-questioned.html), 1984!!), and here the Times speculates on the dubious value of a graphical user interface. The opening line asks: _“Does anyone do windows any more?”_, and the article concludes by predicting “doom” for the upcoming new OS by Microsoft. I thought I’d see if the author had time to reflect on his past predictions, so I looked through the newspaper’s archives, but it looks like he stopped writing technology articles in 1987 and switched to Food and Travel. Anyway.



Here’s a “quote of the month” for you:



> Science is much more ‘sloppy’ and ‘irrational’ than its methodological image.



(Paul Feyerabend, _Against Method_, and I meant to refer to the so-called science of computers)
